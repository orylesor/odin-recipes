# Recipes 
 
## What is this? 
This is my solution to the very first project assigment in [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/). This is also my very first webpage! ðŸ¥³ The task was to create a webpage with 3 recipes. 
 
## What have I learned? 
So it all started with me wanting to get royalty free pictures. Unsplash has a permissive license, they don't even require attribution, but I still wanted to. So I put the attribution below the image. First I used `<p>` and `<br>`. I was wondering where to put it in the code to keep it legible and nice so I googled it. At the same time I was also wondering about nice alt text, so I googled that too. Found a page listing best practices regarding alt text and accessibility. On the page was an example with a picture and a caption. I checked it out with "Inspect" and I saw they use `<figure>`. I looked it up, learned how to use it and that's how I put the caption (the attribution) underneath each image instead of `<p>` and `<br>`. I was surprised there's this specific set of tags for this specific use case. Semantic HTML is awesome. ðŸ˜Ž

I also tried a text to speech Chrome extension, I wanted to experience it. You probably didn't know it tells the user if an element is a heading or a link. I didn't know at least! I also tried it on other webpages, it's infuriating when there's no "jump to main content" link, it's very tedious to jump or wait through all the navigation links. Keyword stuffing in the title attribute is also super frustrating.
